def island_perimeter(grid):

    Calculate the perimeter of the island described in grid.

    Args:
    grid (List[List[int]]): A list of list of integers where:
                            0 represents water
                            1 represents land

    Returns:
    int: The perimeter of the island.

    The function assumes:
    - Each cell is square, with a side length of 1
    - Cells are connected horizontally/vertically (not diagonally).
    - Grid is rectangular, width and height don't exceed 100
    - The grid is completely surrounded by water
    - There is only one island (or nothing).
    - The island doesn't have "lakes"
